Not article written protest Liverpool's poaching Southampton's players last summer
unhealthy obsession
Thanks hooking amazing plane!!!
Who would currently Arsenal right back?
Hopefully Rues. Can play anywhere across front 4 positions. Coming prime. Wenger him.
Ox Start Any England team
I admire way Ath Madrid operate market. Whoever lose
he's already replaced.
Exactly that. Win Win
exactly he's injured. If Ox maybe bigger impact games
I'm sure. Sterling bigger impact prem. England Starter. Slightly ahead ATM.OX needs 8-12 goals yr
Ox player In current market Sterling value ATM. Ox needs score Big goals consistently
If Sterling 50m.....

congratulations Degree.
WHUFC buy Sissoko. They would powerful Midfield.
imagine

What Delph? Looks he's City....
Not biggest fan.. sounds things model professional grafter. Fair play.....What week!!.
Just isn't much noise coming Arsenal
No Benzema???
I see Stoke losing success? + They looking bring Shaquri Glen Johnson etc.

All players Stoke West Brom buy....I Bet would start Villa. Is Phillips/Caulker &gt; Richards/Sinclair etc
I think improve based current squads potential signings looking unlikely beat Stoke West Brom.
By looks things avfc might worst Midlands team again!
tbt March Equality
I'm sure would huge sell fee Campbell. Similar Vela
Any truth Higuian Arsenal?
CAVANI
I wouldnt Liked seing Vela banging goals West Ham TBH
Imagine scenes bought Pogba
seems replacement Mbia

wasn't instead of...Wenger knew Clichy....that worked well.
we've wasted alot money average players Bendtner 50k example
whole piont before. AW dithered Market.
original point could Kompany

Very true
neither. We win enough academy players. Fact
academy key players.NONE. 3/4 winning.Great











regardless first team player. Definitely next yr.

lotus Cheek JT



wengers decision give one...are dumb!















That point.
ok must easy. Name players intention playing then?
Who CFC bought intention playing? Or a.change manager?
We've done similar effect.
You convince Just hope waste squad slightly imbalanced
that's point. I bet last summer turned CB quid
exactly!he knew Koscielny achilles issue Per comin WC
well let's see. I hope spends what's needed
WAS amazing achievement. We need kick Superstars stay.
hasn't filled positions needed win prem. It's Superstars Balance
Yes improved enough. Are happy 3rd?
I ain't moaning stating point. Wenger dithers excuse challenging.
yeah great challenging PL. With AW diposal
I totally understand domino effect. BALE/OZIL would AW spend 50m win PL?
Wenger right would winning PL closer. 10yrs without top2 failure. PL bread butter
funny mate ain't top alone win PL 10yrs. Ain't past Last 16 CL 5 yrs

won Prem CL?
How perception? All I've said AW dithers much. That's fact.
3rd


who? Elite players maybe. Our wages bill exceeds CFC now.
course....but money bank prem combined...we fine

Regardless AW economics dithers market. Too much power club.
Don't need prove Sol Campbell highest paid player prem.
bought Milner including fee? 10-15m. If took 80pw. What diff budget.
2001 AW signed Sol Campbell 100pw

quality players aren't question.It's identifing getting him!
told pay more....so what?....who deal? Chelsea win everything...we save 5m.
many players Utd
what's nonsense? That's Wenger decides budget spent?
way. We've lost many players this....Xaxi Alonso perfect example
Maybe If Rvp went Juve
Only clubs need Giroud
Madrid
many obtainable?

Lewindoski

You can't much higher Arsenal.....
If Giroud Market elite clubs would home list. No doubt
grade




We bare pain polishing Diamonds. Ramsey/Walcott/Coq Etc
Somehow players enough somehow leave Top Clubs.
that's bit harsh. Not many Strikers bring table. That's we'll wait Karim
course I striker remains fit

Maybe acting knob making loads noise early hours morning?
Wonder look forward Andrea Pirlo Manchester City next season. I've honest... I hope so.
I slightly disagree. Giroud 14/15 close RvP 11/12. Ppl forget Rvp missed sitters CL
happened? Loved Millions...
We would think right players available Wenger would buy. Just depends cards falling way.
True....but 60m left?
Would Arsenal fans happy sacrificed Top class DM Nzonzi order Rues?
I think could b yr all. Similar Higuian situation
Yeh seems highly unlikely Aguero. Hopefully alternative Aguero replace Benzema.
what's air? Madrid achievable replacement lined up?

Birmingham's won last fight 8 seconds! How fare UFCGlasgow July 18?
put Avi top letter. They then.

Very happy announce I signed
Photos taken medical...
Petr Cech Arsenal player.
Petr Cech Arsenal still world-class keeper

No way! Bottom half. many times home fail home. Need plan C.....
Not settling different set up. 442 Diamond Jack base ain't bad

Bottom 8 Home games JW AR could share Def responsibilities.
Yes defo MS
Unless meant adapted DLP role AFC
piont Arteta learnt postion arrived. Arteta Flamini gone
doubt. He Carrick. Especially 95% home games
surely MS ability.down positioning timing. Wasn't Arteta B2B mid Everton?
Sniederlain can't develop master Dm?
Coq Flamini Defensive minded MIDs. Not enough sustainable challenge major competitions
Fans turning Wenger prior Puma...scared spend money add serious competition squad.

Why both? We're hardly poor. Didn't think days anymore....
Why doesn't Eng play every player U21 yrs old. Even seniors
Eng haven't enough players understand football. Most players play World Football More spread wealth

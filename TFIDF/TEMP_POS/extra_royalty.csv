If women expected men
Men trust God risking rejection. Women trust God waiting.
No matter dimension
As lovers
The moment realize right person. Only ignorant walk away greatness. InspireMe
The moment losing winning. It moments
The moment realize happiness getting person. They helpmate towards achieving mission. TBT
The moment realize enemy
The moment dreams
The moment stop comparing others undermines worth
The moment realize person cared nothing intellectually spiritually offer
A man's face autobiography. A woman's face fiction.

manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.
It is sometimes referred to as a "Combat Magnum".[1] It was first introduced
in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum. The now discontinued
Colt Python targeted the premium revolver market segment. Some firearm
collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy
Thompson, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the
finest production revolver ever made.""")

Typically people who tweet a lot are positive for good positive tweets and negative tweet based addiction. The people who tweets very less were not found to 
very aggressive about either positive or negative( in terms of sentiment) 

so atleast users to be considered for Negatively aggressive if 

avg Negative Sentiment > 500 

If  Freq > 700 and AgNegSent/year > 700 : Positive case of aggressive

: Strategy:

Take Top 10% of user of entire population. Plot them on the curve.  Try to find the how fast the curve of frequency goes to avg range : 
Definitely dont consider any thing except english

****Its almost safe is to just compute the negative average across the data and marked user who have score 3/4(max(Avg_Score)
